Song association game:

What is it?

Song Association is a local multiplayer game with a minimum requirement of 2 players.

There are 3 game modes to choose from which will decide how many words/rounds in the entire game.
	- 5 words
	- 10 words
	- 15 words 

You can then choose how many players are participating.
	- You can only choose 2 or 4 players.
	- Once youâ€™ve chosen the number of players you will be required to write your names into the colored boxes of your choice

Once the game mode is decided and you pressed start a word will pop up on the screen, a 5 second timer will start as well. In this 5-second time frame you must rather guess a song that includes this word in its lyrics, or guess a song which has this word in its title. The screen will be split into 4 equal sections which are color coded to the player's chosen colors, once pressed on your chosen color, it will be 'selected'. once selected you and only you have to give out your answer to the group. a selection can be overridden if the player did not give the correct answer, by pressing another color (in the case of another player having an answer) or pressing the color again to unselect it.

Whoever selected their color and guessed a correct song the fastest wins the round.




How does it work? 

Uses a List of Words that are applicable to Song association (e.g. words that come up most often in song lyrics and song titles). Once the players presses start game 5, 10, or 15 words that are not repeated will be randomly generated, and will displayed as explained in the 'what is it?' section.
